# MineSweeper

## Introduction
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden “mines” or “bombs” without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. The game originates from the 1960s, and it has been written for many computing platforms in use today. It has many variations and offshoots.

## Our rules of MineSweeper
* Click “Start Game” to begin the game.
* Use the **left click button** on the mouse to select a space on the grid. If you hit a bomb, you lose.
* The numbers on the board represent how many bombs are adjacent to a square. For example, if a square has a “3” on it, then there are 3 bombs next to that square. The bombs could be above, below, right left, or diagonal to the square.
* Avoid all the bombs and expose all the empty spaces to win MineSweeper.
    * Use the numbers to determine where you know a bomb is.
    * You can **right click** a square with the mouse to **place a flag** where you think a bomb is. This allows you to avoid that spot.
